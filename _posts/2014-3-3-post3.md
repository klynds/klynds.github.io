title: Data Sources

There are 3 primary sources of data that will be used to create this visualization:

1. Geographic Regions for WMU’s: The Ministry of Natural resources posts maps of the various boundaries that form the wildlife management units, but these are not available in a raw format for this application. Through use of the  “ArcGIS” geographic dataset tool I was able to extract the layers that represent these regions in a raw format as a ‘.SHP’ shapefile. 

2. Dates & Regulations for each WMU: the open season dates for each WMU are typically published in a physical catalog however there is also a digital distribution of the document in ‘.pdf’ format. Rendering this online document through a web browser will enable us to perform data mining using python libraries such as Selenium and BeautifulSoup much the same way as it was performed in the ‘Toronto Neighbourhood Clustering’ assignment. 

3. POI’s via FourSquare API: Using the FourSquare API through python we can obtain data from a massive volume of venues that are available through the service. For the purposes of this assignment the venues search call with the ‘browse’ parameter will be implemented to determine many results that center around the areas passed to the API.
