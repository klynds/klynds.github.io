Now that I had obtained all required data and had organized it into formats that would be compatible with the folium library, I could begin creating the data visualization. Starting with the ‘OpenStreetMap’ base map I was able to plot the WMU’s using the folium ‘GeoJson’ module. Once this layer had been successfully applied, I was able to read in the ‘.csv’ data containing the season dates and regulations and created a mechanism to populate custom HTML segments for each individual WMU. Once this functionality had been tested, I bound the data to the main map through use of the folium ‘Popup’ module. 
Next, I created an additional layer which would contain the points of interest provided through the FourSquare API. Using a list of coordinates from different regions in the province I was able to make many API calls to populate a dataframe with relevant points of interest from all stretches of Ontario. Using this dataframe I was able to then obtain the street addresses through further API calls and was able to add these records to the map as markers. Once the data was all added to the map, I tweaked the design slightly for ease of usage and added an external module to enable the ‘find my location’ button which allows users to zoom to their location when viewing the map.
