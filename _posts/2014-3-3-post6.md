This assignment provided me with a strong introduction to the geospatial information systems side of data science and allowed me to further explore the many modules of the folium python library. I found that I was able to create an attractive and informative representation of these key provincial regulations which would lend itself to more effectively informing a prospective hunter of the pieces of information that they would require to adopt the hobby. 
Moving forward features that I intend to add would be additional tables under each WMU popup to summarize any additional regulations and important points of contact that may apply to these specific regions. Through this introduction to the GitHub version control software and its integration with the IBM Watson Studio Jupyter Notebook I can retain this project in perpetuity so if I wish to update it for successive years or with additional features it remains readily available.
